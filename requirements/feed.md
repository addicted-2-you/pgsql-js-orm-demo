### The user should be able to view the feed

The feed should be +- unique -- on every load it should be slightly different

#### The user should always have something in their feed

The feed suggestion should have priority
- posts from their folowees
- popular posts (many likes, many views)
- posts from popular users (many followers)

#### The user should be able to remove any post from their feed

Reporting the post should automatically remove it from the reporter's feed

### Blocking a user will remove their posts from the blocker's feed
